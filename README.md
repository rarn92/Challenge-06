06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

The weather app includes a search option, a list of previously searched cities, and displays a five-day forecast and current weather conditions.
